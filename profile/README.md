Hi all,

Welcome to this lovely project. Finishing this project will be a tough journey, so we provide the following resources to assist you:

## Example
We provide 2 example files [dumbsender.py] and [dumbreceiver.py] that implement stop-and-wait with our skeleton codes in peer.py. Go to the repo link: `https://github.com/SUSTech-CS305-Fall22/CS305-Project-Skeleton` to run the example.

## Video Walkthrough
We prepared a video tutorial on how to run the example, hopefully it will be helpful. Go to `https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Se4y1g7Fs` to watch it. Plus, we are planning to host another online walkthrough next week, and there will be Q&A session.

## Discussion Board
We host a discussion board on github for this project. `https://github.com/orgs/SUSTech-CS305-Fall22/discussions` You can follow this organization to get notifications of posted questions.

## In-person Assistance
Our wonderful TA team provides in-person assistance by appointment. Schedules will be released later.

## Checkpoints
Checkpoints are not mandatory, but following them will be helpful to your progress. We will realse different tests at each checkpoint.
