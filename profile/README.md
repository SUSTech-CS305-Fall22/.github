# Request a remote container
Due to winsocket issue, this project cannot run on Windows. We do understand that setting up developing environment is tedious, so we prepare remote containers for every group. You can also set up your local developing environment, and please be advised that your project will be finally graded on Ubuntu 20.04 with python 3.8. If you prefer to request a remote container for your group, please drop an email to 
```

```
with format:
```
Title : Request for remote container −Group{Your−group−number}

Body:

Your team members, and who will be the sudoer.
```
And here is a brief writeup on how to connect to your container via VScode SSH-Remote. [Remote-Writeup](https://github.com/SUSTech-CS305-Fall22/.github/blob/main/Remote_Container_HOWTO.pdf)

Hi all,

Welcome to this lovely project. Finishing this project will be a tough journey, so we provide the following resources to assist you:

## Example
We provide 2 example files [dumbsender.py] and [dumbreceiver.py] that implement stop-and-wait with our skeleton codes in peer.py. Go to the repo link: [Repo](https://github.com/SUSTech-CS305-Fall22/CS305-Project-Skeleton) to run the example.

## Video Walkthrough
We prepared a video tutorial on how to run the example, hopefully it will be helpful. Go to [Walkthrough-Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Se4y1g7Fs) to watch it. Plus, we are planning to host another online walkthrough next week, and there will be Q&A session.

## Discussion Board
We host a discussion board on github for this project. [Discussion Board](https://github.com/orgs/SUSTech-CS305-Fall22/discussions) You can follow this organization to get notifications of posted questions.

## In-person Assistance
